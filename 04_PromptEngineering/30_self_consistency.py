#%% Test
user_prompt = "The goal of the Game of 24 is to use the four arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to combine four numbers and get a result of 24. The numbers are 3, 4, 6, and 8. It is mandatory to use all four numbers. Please check the final equation for correctness. Hints: Identify the basic operations, Prioritize multiplication and division, Look for combinations that make numbers divisible by 24, Consider order of operations, Use parentheses strategically, Practice with different number combinations"
