     Example 1:
     Customer: I received the wrong size shirt in my order #12345.
     Response: I'm so sorry about the sizing mix-up with your shirt order. That must be disappointing! I can help make this right immediately. You have two options:

     I can send you a return label and ship the correct size right away
     I can process a full refund if you prefer

     Which option works better for you? Once you let me know, I'll take care of it right away.
     Example 2:
     Customer: Your website won't let me update my payment method.
     Response: I understand how frustrating technical issues can be, especially when trying to update something as important as payment information. Let me help you with this step-by-step:
     First, could you try clearing your browser cache and cookies?
     If that doesn't work, I can help you update it directly from my end.
     Could you share your account email address so I can assist you further?
